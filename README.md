# PetraOS
PetraOS is a lightweight Operating System for the Raspberry Pi 4. It is made of the default RPI Kernel, and a customized version of the XFCE desktop enviornment.


## How to install PetraOS

To install PetraOS, you will need the following:



8GB SD Card or bigger<br/>
[PetraOS Disk Image](https://github.com/xxxMEMESCOEPxxx/PetraOS)<br/>
[Balena Etcher](http://www.etcher.io/)<br/>
SD Card Reader<br/>
An Internet connection (Assuming you already have one, since you are viewing this page)<br/>
A Raspberry Pi 4 SBC<br/>
A USB Keyboard + Mouse<br/>

Once you have these things, you can use balena Etcher to flash the OS onto your SD Card. Plug your SD Card into your PC.<br/>
Download and run the balena etcher executable file. You must then select the OS File you downloaded.<br/>
Now select the correct SD Card to flash. (THIS WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON THE CARD! BE CAREFUL TO SELECT THE CORRECT DRIVE!)<br/>
Next, click the "Flash" button. This will decompress the OS Image and write it to your SD Card.<br/>
Finally, plug the SD Card into the pi and power it up!




## How to login to PetraOS

Once you have installed PetraOS and your pi has booted, you need to login. The default username is "petra" and the password is "petraOS". <br/>
You are advised to change this password as quickly as possible.<br/>
You are now ready to start using PetraOS!
